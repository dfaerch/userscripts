# Userscript

This is a small collection of userscripts for various purposes.

Note: I exclusively use Firefox, so that's where I test. They likely work on Chrome as well.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Install a Userscript Manager

I recommend [**Violentmonkey**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) â€” a reliable open-source userscript manager for Firefox and Chrome.

Other managers (e.g. Tampermonkey, now closed-source) may work too.

### 2. Clone This Repository (Optional)

If you want to explore or modify the scripts locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfaerch/userscripts.git
cd userscripts
```

---

### 3. Install Scripts

On eg. github, simply click on the \*.user.js file in the listing above, then click the "raw" button, over the source code. Violentmonkey should now prompt you you to install it.

### 4. Enable and Configure

After installation, make sure the script is enabled in Violentmonkey.
